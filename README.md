# Bioinformatics course: Omics data curation with graph dbs

**Course objective**: to learn methods for data curation of omics data through the building and curation of a bacterial omics data. 

## Content

Looking to learn skills through:

- determining orthologs between bacterial species, and loading that information into a graph db
- loading in expression data from RNAseq experiments
- loading in immunoprecipitation data from ...
- incorporating genome annotaiton information through automated piplines (prokka), and also public annotation tools (PATRIC)
