# Bioinformatics course: Omics data curation with graph dbs

## Course information

**Course objective**: to learn methods for data curation of omics data through the building and curation of a bacterial omics data. 

### Content

Looking to learn skills through:

- determining orthologs between bacterial species, and loading that information into a graph db
- loading in expression data from RNAseq experiments
- loading in immunoprecipitation data from ...
- incorporating genome annotaiton information through automated piplines (prokka), and also public annotation tools (PATRIC)

## Directories

- work: scratch directory where I'm working through stuff. This is where I'm learning how to make sausage. 
- assets: pdfs, html files, content to be referenced during learning from either work, or in the readers
- readers: more polished things to describe certain aspects of what I learned
